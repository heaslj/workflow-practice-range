# workflow-practice-range
Sandbox for workflow practice and understanding: branching, merging, and etc.

Experimenting with creating feature branch retroactively:
- create develop branch from master
-- make changes to it
-- push changes to origin/develop
-- rename it (and tracked branch at origin)
create new develop branch from master
-- difference will be that renamed branch won't be off the develop branch, but does that matter?
