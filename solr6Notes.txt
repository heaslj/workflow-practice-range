Solr ALWAYS runs in its embedded jetty container - highly dis-recommended to do otherwise (deploy the war to another container)

SearchManager will run in its own container - jetty or Tomcat

No reason to tie solr instances to SearchManager instances
	see how they perform in different configurations; what works best
