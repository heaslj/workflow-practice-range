Solr ALWAYS runs in its embedded jetty container - highly dis-recommended to do otherwise (deploy the war to another container)

SearchManager will run in its own container - jetty or Tomcat

No reason to tie solr instances to SearchManager instances
	see how they perform in different configurations; what works best


Join queries - the performance challenge is in the delegate process that receives results from two (or more) collections and joins that data together into one response

Review of Solr6 Infrastructure Draft Topology

Zookeeper hosts should not be tied to Solr or SearchManager
	- changing the size of the ZK ensemble is non-trivial
	- ZK embedded in Solr distro is not performant, should only be used for local experimentation
